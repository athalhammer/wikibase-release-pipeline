# Advanced Configuration
On first launch, WBS Deploy will create files in the `./config` directory alongside your `.env` file, the `docker-compose.yml` and `template.env`. This is your instance configuration. **You own and control those files.** Be sure to include them in your backups.

## config/LocalSettings.php

This file is generated by the [MediaWiki installer script](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Install.php) and supplemented by the Wikibase container's `entrypoint.sh` script on first launch. Once this file has been generated, you own and control it. This means that not only *can* you make changes to it, you may *need* to do so for [major version updates](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading#Adapt_your_LocalSettings.php).

If `config/LocalSettings.php` is missing, it triggers the Wikibase container to run the [MediaWiki installer script](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Install.php). If you need to run the installer again, you can remove the generated `LocalSettings.php` file (but keep a backup just in case!) and restart your instance.

## config/wikibase-php.ini
This is Wikibase's `php.ini` override file, a good place for tuning PHP configuration values. It gets loaded by the Wikibase web server's PHP interpreter.

## docker-compose.yml
To further customize your instance, you can also make changes to `docker-compose.yml`. To ease updating to newer versions of WBS Deploy, consider putting your customizations into a new file called `docker-compose.override.yml`. If you do this, you'll need to start using the following commands to restart your instance:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up --wait
```

This way, your changes are kept separate from the original WBS Deploy code.
